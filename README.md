# DP Tools
## A easier way to spam your friends.

This is a project that i'm working to learn more.
Using this you can spam your friends in Discord, or in anywhere.

## Dependencies
- You need python 3.8 installed on your computer
- You also need pyautogui (lib that can be installed with pip) on your computer

## Run
To run the program, just open the file: `DP-Tools.sh`, and the program will start.

## On windows or Mac
To run the program on Windows or Mac, just open the file: `src/index.py`, and the program will start.

## Warnings
Don't exclude any file from the project: `message.txt` or `dp.config` for example. If you do, the program will brake. 

That's it!!! Be happy.
